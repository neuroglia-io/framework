#   github.actor will be the account how will perform the push (or most of the case 'merge pull request'). (May better to use github.triggering_actor for reruns.)
#   secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN was the token creates for the current action, it is associated with the actor and will persist until the end of the action.
#   github.ref_name work fine if the trigger was a push/merge.
